Zarr is a community project to develop specifications and software for
storage of large N-dimensional typed arrays, also commonly known as
tensors. A particular focus of Zarr is to provide support for storage
using distributed systems like cloud object stores, and to enable
efficient I/O for parallel computing applications.
